# The Wiki Game

A command line game that tests your ability to hunt for information.

You're given two Wikipedia links. Get from one link to the other only by hopping links in the bodies of the Wikipedia pages.

## Requirements

Python 3.12

Requires packages defined in ```requirements.txt``` so you might want to create a virtual environment.

## Setup

Open a terminal in the same folder as ```requirements.txt``` and run these commands (inside a virtual environment if needed):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the game

Open a terminal in the same folder as ```game.py``` and run these commands (inside the virtual environment if you made one):
```
py game.py
```
