# The Wiki Game

A console game inspired by my inability to stay focused when I look up something on Wikipedia. 

The aim of the game is to get from one page to another strictly by link-hopping through the links on each Wikipedia page.

## Requirements

Python 3.12. It's just a python script so should run on Windows, Linux, or macOS if you have python installed.

Requires packages defined in ```requirements.txt``` so you might want to create a virtual environment.

## Setup

Open a terminal in the same folder as ```requirements.txt``` and run these commands (inside a virtual environment if needed):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the game

Open a terminal in the same folder as ```game.py``` and run these commands (inside the virtual environment if you made one):
```
py game.py
```
