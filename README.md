# The Wiki Game

A game that tests your ability to hunt for information.

You're given a start and an end link. Get from one place to the other only using links in the body of the Wikipedia page.

## Requirements

Python 3.12

Requires packages defined in ```requirements.txt``` so you might want to create a virtual environment.

## Setup

Run these commands (inside a virtual environment if needed):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the game

Run
```
py game.py
```
